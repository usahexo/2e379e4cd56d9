#  Foxwoods Casino Launches Blackjack Lanza

Foxwoods Casino has just announced the launch of its all new Blackjack Lanza game. The innovative new game is designed to bring an added level of excitement and anticipation to the blackjack experience.

Blackjack Lanza offers players the chance to hit a bonus payout of up to 500x their original bet. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the bonus payout is triggered when the player receives two jokers as their first two cards.

Players can increase their chances of triggering the bonus payout by increasing their bet amount. However, they must be careful not to push their luck too far, as going over 21 will result in a bust and a loss of their bet amount.

The game is available now at Foxwoods Casino, and we expect it to be a big hit with blackjack fans looking for an added thrill and excitement from their game.

According to Foxwoods Casino spokesperson Lydia Sherwood, “Blackjack Lanza is perfect for players looking for an exciting new blackjack game with plenty of betting options. With its fast-paced action and big payouts, this game is sure to get your heart racing!”
