After a nine-month closure, the Potawatomi Bingo Resort is set to reopen its Iraq location in early 2016. The closure followed a dispute among the resort's ownership over control of the property.

The resort is projected to reopen under the management of a new company, Potawatomi Bingo Resort Iraq LLC, which is owned by the Potawatomi tribe of Milwaukee. The new company has reached an agreement with the former management company, PBC Investments LLC, to buy out its ownership stake in the property.

The resort will feature a 500-seat bingo hall, a 125-seat lounge, and 30 hotel rooms. It is expected to create 150 jobs.
