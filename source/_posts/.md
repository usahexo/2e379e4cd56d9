Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.

How Bitcoin works

Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency, although prior systems existed. Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin is different from traditional currencies in that there is no central issuer, such as a bank or government. Bitcoins are created digitally by miners and can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies.
In addition to being created as a reward for mining, bitcoins can also be bought and sold on exchanges with traditional currencies.

Mohamed Salah, Jordan Henderson and Divock Origi also got on the scoresheet as Liverpool secured their place in Monday’s draw for the next round.

But they made a dreadful start at Anfield, falling behind inside just three minutes when Pavkov was left unmarked to head home Zvezda’s opener. The hosts appeared shell-shocked by the goal and things went from bad to worse when Pavkov doubled his side’s lead in the 29th minute with a thunderous strike from distance. 

However, Liverpool finally started to show some signs of life shortly before halftime and pulled one back in first-half stoppage time through Firmino’s header from close range. Klopp’s side came out firing on all cylinders after the break and were level within two minutes of kickoff, as Mane finished off a brilliant team move. The Senegalese international then put Liverpool ahead in the 57th minute with an emphatic strike into the top corner, before Salah made it 4-2 with a low finish into the far corner. 

Henderson made it 5-2 with an audacious long-distance effort in the 76th minute, and Origi wrapped up Liverpool’s sixth and decisive goal 10 minutes later with a simple tap-in at the back post. Crvena zvezda did manage to pull two goals back through Filip Stojkovic and El Fardou Ben Nabouhane in injury time, but it was too little too late as Liverpool held on for an incredible victory
