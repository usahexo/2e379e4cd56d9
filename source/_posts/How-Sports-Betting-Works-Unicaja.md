#  How Sports Betting Works: Unicaja

Spain's Unicaja Malaga takes on Turkish Airlines EuroLeague power Maccabi Tel Aviv in one of the most intriguing matchups of the Round of 16. The teams met twice in the group stage, with each squad winning on its home floor.

The first matchup was a thriller, with Unicaja rallying from 18 down in the fourth quarter to win 92-89. Tel Aviv led by as many as 13 points before Unicaja took control in the final period. Forward Juancho Hernangomez had 28 points and nine rebounds for Unicaja, while American guard Jeremy Evans had 19 points and 10 boards. For Tel Aviv, forward Devin Smith led all scorers with 22 points.

In their second meeting, Unicaja was without star center Walter Tavares, who was out with an injury. That didn't seem to matter, as Tel Aviv couldn't find its offensive rhythm in a 71-53 defeat. Guard Alberto Abalde led Unicaja with 16 points, while forward Quincy Miller added 14. Smith led Tel Aviv with just seven points on 3-of-12 shooting.

Which team will prevail this time? Let's take a look at how sports betting works to find out.

When two teams meet in any sport, there are three possible outcomes: the home team wins, the away team wins, or it's a draw. In order to place a wager on one of those outcomes, the bettor must first find a sportsbook that offers betting on that particular event. Once that's done, he or she must then decide how much money to wager and what type of bet to make.

There are two main types of bets: straight bets and parlays. With a straight bet, the bettor simply bets on which team will win or lose. With a parlay, however, the bettor combines two or more individual bets into one larger wager and gets a higher payout if all of those bets win.

In order to calculate potential payouts for both types of bets, the sportsbook uses something called "point spreads." A point spread is simply a numerical value assigned to each team by the sportsbook that reflects that team's chances of winning or losing the game outright. So for example, if Team A is favored by four points over Team B, that means Team A is expected to win by four points or more but can still lose the game outright if they only win by three points or less. In effect, Team B is given +4 points so that people who want to bet on them have a better chance of winning their bet (as long as they don't lose by more than four points).

Now let's take a look at an actual sporting event and see how this all plays out using Unicaja Malaga as our example. First we'll look at their odds to win outright:

 As you can see, Unicaja is given odds of -190 (meaning you would have to wager $190 to win $100) to win the game against Maccabi Tel Aviv (+155), who are considered underdogs in this matchup despite being one of the top teams in Europe.

But what if you don't feel confident enough in predicting who will win? Well then you might want to consider betting on the point spread instead. Let's say you think Unicaja will beat Maccabi handily but you're not sure they'll cover the four-point spread assigned to them by the sportsbook. You could then place a wager on them winning by five or more points (known as an "over" bet), which would give you better odds than just betting on them to win outright:
