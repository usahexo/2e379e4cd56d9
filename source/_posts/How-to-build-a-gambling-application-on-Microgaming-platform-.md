#  How to build a gambling application on Microgaming platform 

In this article, we are going to create a simple gambling application using the Microgaming platform. This will be a basic blackjack game that can be used for practice or entertainment.

To begin, we need to create a new project in the Microgaming development environment. We can do this by clicking on the “New Project” button and then selecting “Project from Template”.

Next, we need to select the “Blackjack” template and give our project a name.

Once the project has been created, we need to open the main file (main.js) and add some basic code:

window.onload = function() { // initialize the game engine var game = new Blackjack(); // create a player object var player = { "name": "Johnny Bravo", "money": 100 }; // add player to the game engine game.players.push(player); // deal two cards to the player game.deal(player, 2); }; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 window . onload = function ( ) { // initialize the game engine var game = new Blackjack ( ) ; // create a player object var player = { "name" : "Johnny Bravo" , "money" : 100 } ; // add player to the game engine game . players . push ( player ) ; // deal two cards to the player game . deal ( player , 2 ) ; } ;

In this code, we first define a function that will be executed when the page has finished loading. This function simply initializes our blackjack game engine and creates a player object with some basic information. We then add this player object to the game engine and deal two cards to them.

Now let’s take a look at how our blackjack game is implemented:

var Blackjack = { /* Main class for blackjack */ init: function() { // set up the deck of cards this.deck = []; for (var i = 0; i < 52; ++i) { this.deck[i] = new Card(i); } }, /* Deal two cards to the given Player */ deal: function(player, num) { if (!player || num < 1) return; /* empty handed */ this._deal(player, 0, true); }, /* _Deal one card at random from deck */ _deal: function(player, seatIndex, flipped) { if (!player || num < 1) return; /* empty handed */ var card = this.deck[seatIndex]; if (!card) return; if (flipped) card +=suitOffset; else card -= suitOffset; if (!card) return; card %= 4; /* Modulus by 4 gives us which suit */ return card === '2' ? 'clubs' : card === '3' ? 'diamonds' : card === '4' ? 'hearts' : card === '5' ? 'spades'; }, getPlayerSeatIndex: function(player) { return this._getSeatIndex(player); }, ... }; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357

#  How to make money with a gambling application

There are plenty of potential ways to make money with a gambling application. The most obvious way is to simply take a cut of the stakes that are played through the platform. This can be done in a number of ways, such as taking a percentage of each wager, charging a membership fee, or taking a commission on wins and losses.

Another way to make money with a gambling application is through advertising. This can be done in a couple of ways. The first is by displaying ads to players while they are playing. The second is by selling advertising space on the website or within the app itself.

Finally, you can make money with a gambling application by offering bonuses and rewards to players. This can be done in a number of ways, such as giving players bonus points for signing up, awarding bonus points for referring friends, or providing loyalty rewards for regular players.
