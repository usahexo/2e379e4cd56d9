Most Georgians will be able to tell you that Adjarabet is a Georgian word, but not many people know its exact meaning. Adjarabet is a combination of two words: “adjar” and “abet”. “Adjar” means “extra” or “outside of”, while “abet” means “to help”. So, when put together, Adjarabet can be translated as “the place outside of helping” or simply as “the helping place”.
