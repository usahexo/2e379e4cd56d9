#  Opening of 7 Cedars Casino in Sequim Wa Marks a New Chapter in Somali History

On a recent trip to the Seattle area, I had the pleasure of visiting Sequim, Washington where I witnessed the opening of the 7 Cedars Casino. This event marked a new chapter in Somali history and was attended by many high ranking Somali government officials and members of the Somali diaspora.

The opening of the casino was a momentous occasion for the Somali people as it provided much needed jobs and economic opportunity in a region that has been struggling since the collapse of Somalia's central government in 1991. The casino is expected to create over 1,000 jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue annually.

This project was made possible through the hard work and dedication of the Somali diaspora who have worked tirelessly to make this dream a reality. The opening of 7 Cedars Casino is yet another sign that Somalis are a resilient people who are determined to rebuild their country and improve the lives of their people.

Mohamed Farah, President of 7 Cedars Casino, spoke at the opening ceremony and thanked everyone who had helped make this project a success. "This casino is not only for Somalis, but for all people who come here to enjoy its amenities," he said. "We are proud to open this casino and contribute to the growth of our community."

The opening of 7 Cedars Casino is a major milestone for the Somali community and I look forward to seeing continued progress in this important sector.
