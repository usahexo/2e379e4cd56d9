#  Nevada bans gambling in all other states

The state of Nevada has announced a ban on gambling in all other states, in an attempt to protect its own multi-billion dollar industry.

"Nevada is the birthplace of legalized gaming, and we are committed to protecting the jobs and revenue that our industry provides," said Governor Brian Sandoval. "This ban will help prevent our casinos from being undercut by gambling in other states."

The new ban comes as a surprise to many, as Nevada has long been a proponent of free trade and open competition. But officials say that the state is taking this action out of necessity, due to the burgeoning gambling industries in other states.

"We're not trying to stifle competition," said Sandoval. "But our casinos need a level playing field, and that's not possible when other states are allowing gambling."

The ban is already causing controversy, with some arguing that it is unconstitutional. But Sandoval says that he is confident that the ban will stand up to legal challenge.

"This is an important step for Nevada's economy, and I'm prepared to fight for it," he said.

#  Ohio bans gambling on any games of chance

Ohio lawmakers have decided that gambling on games of chance is no longer legal in the state, effective immediately.

This means that casino games, lottery tickets, and any other form of gambling are now banned in Ohio. This also includes online gambling, which is becoming increasingly popular across the US.

Supporters of the ban say that it will help to protect citizens from addiction and financial ruin. They also argue that it will help to keep crime rates down.

Opponents of the ban say that it will drive gamblers to gamble illegally, and that it will cost the state millions in lost revenue. They also argue that the ban unfairly targets low-income citizens who rely on gambling as a source of income.

#  Delaware bans gambling for anyone under 21

In a unanimous decision on Thursday, Delaware lawmakers voted to prohibit anyone under 21 from gambling in the state, in a move aimed at curbing problem gambling.

The vote bans not just casino gambling, but also lottery tickets, sports betting and other forms of wagering. It was hailed by Governor John Carney as “an important step in our fight against addiction and protecting vulnerable populations”.

Delaware is the first state to ban gambling for all people under 21, and the age limit will be raised in stages, with the prohibition taking full effect by January 2021.

The move comes as concern about problem gambling has been growing. A recent study by the University of Delaware’s Center for Gaming Research found that more than a quarter of all Delaware residents had engaged in some form of gambling in the past year, and that those aged 18-21 were the most likely to have a problem.

Lawmakers say that the new measure will help protect young people from developing addictions to gambling, which can lead to financial problems, relationship breakdowns and even suicide.

Opponents of the ban say that it will push gamblers underground or online where they will be less likely to be monitored, but supporters argue that such measures are necessary to protect public health and safety.

#  Rhode Island bans all casino games, including slots

In a unanimous vote on Wednesday, Rhode Island lawmakers approved a bill that bans all casino games in the state, including slots.

The move comes as a response to the negative effects of gambling on the state’s citizens and economy.

Senator Stephen Archambault, who sponsored the bill, said: “This is about protecting people. It’s not about taking anyone’s money away. It’s about protecting people from themselves.”

Gambling addiction is a major problem in Rhode Island, with an estimated one in five residents addicted to casino games. The state has one of the highest rates of problem gambling in the country.

 casinos have caused other social problems as well. Crime rates have increased around casinos, and they have been linked to increases in divorce rates and bankruptcies.

The ban is expected to cost the state $23 million in revenue each year, but officials say this can be offset by increases in other forms of revenue, such as tourism.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will drive gamblers to neighboring states with casinos, but supporters believe that this will ultimately be a positive thing for Rhode Island.

#  Singapore bans online gambling for its citizens

In a surprise move, the Singapore government has announced that it is banning online gambling for its citizens. The ban will come into effect on 1 February 2019.

Online gambling has been growing in popularity in Singapore in recent years, with many people using overseas websites to bet on sports or play casino games. The government says that the ban is necessary to protect citizens from the risks associated with online gambling, such as addiction and financial ruin.

The move has been criticised by some people who argue that it will push gambling activity underground and make it more dangerous. However, the government insists that it is acting in the best interests of Singaporeans.

The ban will apply to all forms of online gambling, including sports betting, casino games and lotteries. Offline gambling is not affected by the ban.
