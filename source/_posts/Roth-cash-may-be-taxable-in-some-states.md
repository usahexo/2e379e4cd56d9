#  Roth cash may be taxable in some states

Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so they're not taxable when you take distributions in retirement. This feature has made the Roth a popular choice for retirement savings. But what happens if you move to a state that taxes Roth IRAs?

The short answer is that it depends on the state. Some states, like Colorado, treat Roth contributions as regular income and tax them accordingly. Other states, like California, allow Roth conversions without any added taxes. You'll need to check with your state's tax authority to find out how your state treats Roth contributions.

If you're moving to a state that taxes Roth IRAs, there are a few things you can do to reduce the impact on your tax bill:

1. Convert some of your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. This will help reduce the amount of taxable income in your new state.

2. Keep your Roth contributions in a nationally-taxable account like a 401(k) or an individual brokerage account. This will keep them from being taxed in your new state.

3. Move your Roth IRA funds to a state with no income tax, like Florida or Texas. This is the easiest solution, but it's not always possible depending on where you live.

No matter what you do, be sure to consult with a tax professional before making any moves with your retirement accounts. They can help you figure out the best way to stay compliant with both federal and state tax laws.

#  Roth conversions taxable in some states

Income from Roth conversions may be taxable in some states, even if the money is not withdrawn from the account.

Roth conversions are a popular way to reduce taxes in retirement. The money is moved from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, and the conversion is taxed as income in the year that it occurs.

This can be a great way to save on taxes in retirement, since taxes are paid upfront at a lower rate, rather than later when income may be higher.

However, not all states treat Roth conversions in the same way. In some states, the entire amount of the conversion will be taxed as income, even if the money is not withdrawn from the account.

This can significantly reduce the tax savings of Roth conversions, so it's important to check with your state tax department to see how they treat these accounts.

If you live in a state that taxes Roth conversions, there are several ways to minimize or avoid the tax liability.

One option is to spread out the conversion over several years, so that only part of it is taxable in each year. You can also move money from other accounts into the Roth account in order to minimize the taxable portion of the conversion.

And if you have Roth accounts in multiple states, you can choose which state's rules to follow for each conversion. This can be helpful if one state has a lower tax rate than another.

Taxpayers should always consult with a tax professional before making any decisions about their retirement accounts.

#   Roth IRA earnings taxable in some states

The Roth IRA is a great investment vehicle for saving for retirement, but depending on your state of residence, the earnings on your contributions may be taxable.

Most states do not tax Roth IRA earnings, but there are a handful that do. The states that currently tax Roth IRA earnings are:

California
Arizona
New Jersey
Wisconsin
Minnesota

If you reside in one of these states, it's important to be aware of the tax implications before contributing to a Roth IRA. While most of the time the earnings will be tax-free, in some cases you may end up paying taxes on them.

#   States that are usually blackjack illegal for Roth IRAs

There are a few states that have laws prohibiting gambling, and as a result, those activities are also off-limits for Roth IRA contributions. The states that generally prohibit any type of gambling include:

Alabama
Arizona
Arkansas
Iowa
Louisiana
Montana
Nevada

#   Which states are usually blackjack illegal for Roths?

There are some states in the US where blackjack is illegal for Roth IRA investors. The list of states includes: Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming.

If you live in one of these states and are considering a Roth IRA conversion with blackjack profits, be aware that there is a good chance your state will not allow it. You can check with an accountant or financial planner to see if your state is one of those that prohibits blackjack-related Roth IRA conversions.

However, even if your state does not explicitly prohibit this type of conversion, there is always a risk that the particular transaction will be deemed invalid by the IRS or by a court. This could lead to significant penalties and taxes owed on the entire amount of the conversion – so it’s definitely something to consider before moving forward.
