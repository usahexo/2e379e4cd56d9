Rowan Atkinson is known for his many comedic talents, but now he's given gamers a few tips on how to play blackjack in the popular video game "GTA 5."

#  How to Play Like Rowan Atkinson in 'GTA 5': Blackjack Edition

In Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5), you can play blackjack with various NPCs at the various casino locations in the game. Learning how to play blackjack like Rowan Atkinson can provide you with hours of fun and amusement as you attempt to beat the house and make some serious cash.

To start, the basic goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The dealer will also try to get as close to 21 as possible, but they must always hit on 16 or less, and stand on 17 or more. You can also double your bet after seeing your first two cards (as long as you have enough money), and you can split a hand if you are dealt two cards of the same rank.

There are a few basic tips that will help you play blackjack like Rowan Atkinson:

- Always try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

- If the dealer has a visible card worth 10, they are likely to bust (go over 21). Try to take advantage of this by betting high when the dealer is showing a low card.

- Avoid splitting pairs if there is a good chance of busting (going over 21).

- Double down if you have a strong hand (typically 11 or more). doubling down means betting twice your original bet, and in return you receive just one more card.

#  Rowan Atkinson's Best Blackjack Tips for 'GTA 5' Players

When it comes to playing blackjack in the world of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5, there's no one better to learn from than Rowan Atkinson. The actor and comedian, who is famous for his roles in the 'Mr. Bean' television series and movies, offers up some great tips for players looking to make some serious bank at the blackjack tables.

According to Atkinson, one of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack in GTA 5 is to never bet more than you can afford to lose. This may seem like common sense, but it's easy to get carried away while playing and risk more money than you intended. Another key piece of advice from Atkinson is not to split pairs of Aces or 8s - instead, just keep playing them as they are.

If you're looking to maximize your chances of winning big at the blackjack table, Atkinson also recommends betting on the Banker rather than on yourself. This isn't always a guaranteed win, but statistically speaking, the Banker bet has a slightly higher chance of coming out on top. Finally, if you find yourself stuck with a bad hand, don't be afraid to fold and cut your losses. There's no shame in losing a little money - just make sure you don't go overboard and end up spending more than you intended!
