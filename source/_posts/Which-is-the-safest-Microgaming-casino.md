#  How do I withdraw money from a Microgaming casino?

To withdraw money from a Microgaming casino, you will need to provide some identification documents and submit a withdrawal request. The withdrawal process generally takes between 24 and 72 hours to be completed, but may take longer during periods of high traffic.

When you make your first withdrawal from a Microgaming casino, you will be required to provide proof of identity. This can be done by submitting a copy of your driver's license, passport, or other government-issued ID. In order to ensure that your funds are transferred securely, Microgaming may also require you to provide proof of address. This can be done by submitting a recent utility bill or bank statement that displays your name and address.

Once your identity has been verified, you can submit a withdrawal request by logging into your casino account and navigating to the Cashier section. Select the Withdrawal option and enter the amount that you would like to withdraw. You will then be prompted to choose the payment method that you would like to use. Available payment methods vary from casino to casino, but may include wire transfer, credit card, or Bitcoin.

After you have submitted your withdrawal request, it will be reviewed by the Casino’s financial department. Once it has been approved, the funds will be transferred securely to your chosen payment method.
