Nearly every car on the road had a little FM receiver that could pick up one of two signals: one playing music commercial-free and the other broadcasting talk radio.</p>
<p>I was working as a software salesman at the time and spent my days driving from office to office, demoing our latest product. I’d often tune into one of the satellite stations for company, and it wasn’t long before I started to hear about this new game called poker.</p>
<p>The commentators were fascinated by it, describing how players were bluffing their way to huge pots worth tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. I was hooked.</p>
<p>The problem was that, at the time, poker wasn’t legal in most states. So I put off learning how to play for a few years until I moved to Nevada where it was legalized.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been playing regularly both online and in live casinos, making a good living in the process. In this article, I’m going to teach you how to do the same.</p>
<p>But first, let’s take a quick look at what Texas Hold’em is all about.</p>
<p>Texas Hold’em is a variation of poker that is played with two cards in your hand and five community cards on the table. The goal is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your two cards and the community cards.</p>
<p>There are three different types of bets that you can make in Texas Hold’em: preflop, flop, and turn.</p>
<p>The preflop bet is made before any of the community cards are shown and is simply a wager on which player has the best hand preflop (based on their two hole cards). The flop bet is made after the first three community cards have been revealed and is a bet on which player has the best hand at that point. The turn bet is made after the fourth community card has been revealed and is a wager on which player has the best hand at that point.</p>
<p>Once all bets have been placed, each player will reveal their two cards (their hole cards) and make their best five-card hand using any combination of those two cards and the community cards. The player with the best hand wins the pot!</p>
