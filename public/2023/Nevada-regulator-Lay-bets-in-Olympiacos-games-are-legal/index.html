        <h1 id="Nevada-regulator-Lay-bets-in-Olympiacos-games-are-legal"><a href="#Nevada-regulator-Lay-bets-in-Olympiacos-games-are-legal" class="headerlink" title="Nevada regulator: Lay bets in Olympiacos games are legal"></a>Nevada regulator: Lay bets in Olympiacos games are legal</h1><p>LAS VEGAS – Nevada Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett says it’s legal for people in the state to place bets on games involving Olympiacos, the Greek professional basketball club.<br>The statement came in response to a query from The Associated Press about a person who said they were told by a Las Vegas sports book that they could not bet on Olympiacos because the team is considered part of Greece’s national sport.</p>
<p>“To the best of our knowledge, there is no prohibition against betting on Olympic games, whether those Olympics are domestic or international,” Burnett wrote in an email.<br>He added that board attorneys would review the matter if someone filed a formal complaint.</p>
<p>Stephen Espinoza, executive vice president and general counsel for Showtime Networks Inc., which has televised professional boxing and mixed martial arts events in Nevada since 2002, said he was unaware of any prohibition against betting on Olympiacos games.<br>“We’ve never heard anything about it,” Espinoza said. “And I can tell you that our compliance people would have picked up on it if there was.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for Greek gambling company Intralot, which holds a exclusive contract to provide all sports betting products for the national lottery operator Hellenic Lotteries, said the company does not offer any bets on Olympiacos games.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-sports-books-clear-1-million-in-lay-bets-on-Olympiacos-game"><a href="#Nevada-sports-books-clear-1-million-in-lay-bets-on-Olympiacos-game" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sports books clear $1 million in lay bets on Olympiacos game"></a>Nevada sports books clear $1 million in lay bets on Olympiacos game</h1><p>In a rare move, Nevada’s sports books came out ahead on a single game after taking in $1 million in lay bets on Olympiacos Piraeus to beat CSKA Moscow.</p>
<p>The books made their money by taking in $8 million in wagers on CSKA Moscow, the heavy favorite in the game. Most of that money was from bettors who wanted to take advantage of what they believed was an inflated line.</p>
<p>“I had no idea it would go this way,” said John Avello, executive director of race and sports at the Wynn Las Vegas. “We took a beating on every other game (over the weekend). That’s why I love this business.”</p>
<p>While it is not uncommon for Nevada’s sports books to take lay bets - wagers placed against the favorite - it is rare for them to come out ahead when those bets are this large. In fact, Avello could only recall one other time when it happened.</p>
<p>“It definitely doesn’t happen very often,” he said. “But when you get these type of lopsided games, sometimes you do get a winner.”</p>
<h1 id="Why-the-increase-in-lay-betting-on-Olympiacos"><a href="#Why-the-increase-in-lay-betting-on-Olympiacos" class="headerlink" title="Why the increase in lay betting on Olympiacos?"></a>Why the increase in lay betting on Olympiacos?</h1><p>In the Greek Super League, Olympiacos has always been the top team. With the recent economic crisis, however, other teams have been catching up and even overtaking Olympiacos in terms of wins. As a result, Olympiacos’ fans have turned to lay betting as a way to ensure that their team continues to dominate.</p>
<p>A lay bet is a type of bet where you guess that an event will not happen. For example, if you think that Olympiacos will not win their next game, you would place a lay bet on that outcome. If your prediction is correct, you will win money; if not, you will lose money.</p>
<p>The popularity of lay betting on Olympiacos is likely due to several factors. First, Olympiacos has been the top team for so long that their fans are used to winning. When another team starts to overtake them, it can be difficult for fans to adjust their expectations. Second, the recent economic crisis has made it more difficult for people to afford tickets to see live games. Lay betting allows fans to support their team without having to spend money on tickets. Finally, online platforms make it easy for fans to place bets on their favorite teams.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that the increase in lay betting on Olympiacos is here to stay. As long as Olympiacos remains one of the top teams in Greece, their fans will continue to use lay betting as a way to ensure victory.</p>
<h1 id="Fans-in-Nevada-taking-advantage-of-lay-betting-on-Olympiacos"><a href="#Fans-in-Nevada-taking-advantage-of-lay-betting-on-Olympiacos" class="headerlink" title="Fans in Nevada taking advantage of lay betting on Olympiacos"></a>Fans in Nevada taking advantage of lay betting on Olympiacos</h1><p>One thing that the Nevada Gaming Commission is certain of is that the latest expansion in sports betting to include international soccer matches has been a big hit among fans in the state. In particular, there has been a lot of interest in wagering on Olympiacos, the iconic Greek club that is one of the most successful teams in Europe.</p>
<p>Most bettors are not just taking advantage of the opportunity to lay money on Olympiacos games, but they are also interested in betting on matchups against teams from other countries. This was evidenced by the large number of bets that were placed on Olympiacos when they played Tottenham Hotspur, one of England’s top clubs.</p>
<p>While some people may be hesitant to bet on a team from a faraway country, there is no question that Olympiacos has a huge following all over the world. This was clearly evident when they played at Wembley Stadium last year and nearly 60,000 fans showed up to see them in action.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this popularity continues now that Nevada has legalized betting on international soccer matches. In particular, it will be fascinating to see how Olympiacos does against some of the best clubs in Europe.</p>
<h1 id="Greek-soccer-giant-Olympiacos-comes-to-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Greek-soccer-giant-Olympiacos-comes-to-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Greek soccer giant Olympiacos comes to Las Vegas"></a>Greek soccer giant Olympiacos comes to Las Vegas</h1><p>In a preseason exhibition match, Olympiacos of the Greek Superleague will take on MLS side Las Vegas Lights FC at Cashman Field.</p>
<p>The marquee matchup is a coup for Lights FC, who join the likes of German powerhouse Bayern Munich and English Premier League side West Ham United in scheduled matches at Cashman this year. It will also be Olympiacos’ first match in the United States since 1990.</p>
<p>“We are excited to welcome Olympiacos to Las Vegas,” said LVLightsFC Club President Brett Lashbrook. “This is a historic match for our club and our fans as we welcome one of the most decorated clubs in world soccer to our city.”</p>
<p>Olympiacos were founded in 1925 and have won 36 Greek league championships, making them the most successful club in Greece. They have also won 13 Greek Cups and reached the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League twice.</p>
<p>The match is scheduled for Wednesday, February 13 at 8:00PM PST and tickets are available at www. LightsFC.com&#x2F;Tickets .</p>
