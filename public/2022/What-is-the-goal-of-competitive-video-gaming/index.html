The International Olympic Committee is even considering adding it as a medal event in the future. But who are the people behind this rapidly growing industry?</p>
<p>Esports athletes come from all walks of life. While some may have started playing video games casually with friends, others have been competing at a high level for years. Some of the most famous players in the world started out playing games like “Dota 2” and “League of Legends” in their teenage years.</p>
<p>Many professional gamers began their careers by streaming their gameplay on sites like Twitch.tv. This allowed them to build a following and connect with fans from all over the world.

<h1 id="How-do-people-participate-in-competitive-video-gaming"><a href="#How-do-people-participate-in-competitive-video-gaming" class="headerlink" title="How do people participate in competitive video gaming?"></a>How do people participate in competitive video gaming?</h1><p>Competitive video gaming, also known as eSports, has become a popular phenomenon in recent years.

<h1 id="What-are-the-different-types-of-competitive-video-gaming"><a href="#What-are-the-different-types-of-competitive-video-gaming" class="headerlink" title="What are the different types of competitive video gaming?"></a>What are the different types of competitive video gaming?</h1><p>The world of competitive video gaming, also known as eSports, is constantly growing and evolving. With new games and genres being introduced to the competitive scene every year, it can be difficult to keep track of all the different types of competitive gaming out there.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to take a look at the four most popular types of competitive video gaming: first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS),Massively Multiplayer Online Battle Arena or MOBA, and fighting games.</p>
<p>First up is FPS games. These are games where the action takes place from a first-person perspective, and typically involve shooting enemies in order to progress through the game. The two most popular FPS games right now are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and Overwatch.</p>
<p>In RTS games, players must use their strategic skills to control armies of units and defeat their opponents. The two most popular RTS games are StarCraft II and Warcraft III.</p>
<p>Next up are MOBA games. In these games, players control a single character in an online battlefield, working together with other players to achieve victory. The two most popular MOBAs are League of Legends and DOTA 2.</p>
<p>Finally, we have fighting games. These are games that typically pit two characters against each other in a one-on-one battle, with the aim of knocking out the opponent’s health bar first. The two most popular fighting games are Street Fighter V and Tekken 7.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-future-of-competitive-video-gaming"><a href="#What-is-the-future-of-competitive-video-gaming" class="headerlink" title="What is the future of competitive video gaming?"></a>What is the future of competitive video gaming?</h1><p>It is difficult to predict the future of competitive gaming. However, there are several factors that suggest that competitive gaming will continue to grow in popularity. These factors include the rise of live streaming services, the development of new technologies, and the increasing number of people who are playing video games.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why competitive gaming is growing in popularity is because it is a very spectator-friendly activity. This was evident in the recent League of Legends World Championship, which attracted over 43 million viewers online. In addition, competitive gaming is often broadcast on live streaming services such as Twitch, which has over 100 million active users. As a result, competitive gaming has a large potential audience that can be reached through these platforms.</p>
<p>Another factor that is driving the growth of competitive gaming is the development of new technologies, such as virtual reality (VR). VR technology has the potential to improve the immersive experience for spectators, and it may also be used to create new forms of gameplay. For example, a VR headset could be used to allow players to compete against each other in different virtual environments. This would create a more immersive experience for spectators and players alike.</p>
<p>Lastly, another reason why competitive gaming is growing in popularity is because an increasing number of people are playing video games. In fact, there are now over 2 billion gamers worldwide, and this number is expected to continue to grow in the future. This provides a large potential pool of players who could potentially become interested in competitive gaming.</p>
<p>Overall, there are several factors that suggest that competitive gaming will continue to grow in popularity in the future. This growth will likely be fuelled by platforms like Twitch and by the development of new technologies like VR. As a result, we can expect to see more large-scale tournaments and more spectators tuning in to watch them.</p>
