However, there are specific times when the dealer must stand regardless of the cards he is holding. In the state of North Carolina, for example, the dealer must stand on all 17s except in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The key distinction to understand is whether or not the dealer has a “blackjack” hand. A blackjack hand is defined as an Ace and a 10-point card. If the dealer has a blackjack hand, he must stand. If the dealer does not have a blackjack hand, then he must hit on any 17, including those hands with an Ace.</p>
<p>There are two basic situations in which the dealer must hit on all 17s: when both the player and dealer are using traditional Spanish 21 rules and when both the player and dealer are using Vegas Strip rules. In all other cases, including when one or both of the players are using variants of these rules, the dealer must stand on all 17s.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-Stays-at-Table-in-some-Blackjack-Games-in-North-Carolina"><a href="#Dealer-Stays-at-Table-in-some-Blackjack-Games-in-North-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Dealer Stays at Table in some Blackjack Games in North Carolina"></a>Dealer Stays at Table in some Blackjack Games in North Carolina</h1><p>In a recent ruling, the North Carolina Court of Appeals determined that a blackjack dealer does not have to leave the table after losing a hand. The case in question revolved around a blackjack game at the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. In that game, dealer Michelle Rogers lost a hand and was asked to leave the table. She refused and was subsequently fired.</p>
<p>The appellate court determined that since Rogers was not an employee of the casino, she could not be fired for refusing to leave the table. The court also found that while dealers are generally required to leave the table after losing a hand, there is no specific provision in North Carolina law that requires them to do so.</p>
<p>This ruling could have far-reaching implications for blackjack dealers in North Carolina. It could mean that they can stay at the table even after losing multiple hands in a row. It could also mean that casinos cannot fire dealers for refusing to leave the table.</p>
<p>While this ruling is good news for dealers, it may not be good news for casinos. With dealers able to stay at the table longer, casinos may see less profits from blackjack games. This could lead to casinos reconsidering their policies for dealing with dealers who lose hands.</p>

In North Carolina, there are specific rules regulating when the dealer must leave the table.</p>
<p>If the dealer has a bust card and all other players have either folded or remain in the game, then the dealer must leave the table. If all players have either folded or remained in the game and the dealer has not busted, then the dealer must continue playing.</p>
<p>The dealer is also forced to leave the table if they expose their hole card. This can happen if:</p>
<p>-The dealer overturns their cards while sorting them (this automatically results in a loss for that hand).<br>-The dealer accidentally drops their cards and one or both are revealed.<br>-Cards from one deck become mixed with cards from another deck (this can happen if several decks are used).</p>
<p>If any of these situations occur, then play immediately ends and all active players at the table automatically lose.</p>
<h1 id="When-Dealer-is-Allowed-to-Stay-at-the-Table-during-Blackjack-in-NC"><a href="#When-Dealer-is-Allowed-to-Stay-at-the-Table-during-Blackjack-in-NC" class="headerlink" title="When Dealer is Allowed to Stay at the Table during Blackjack in NC?"></a>When Dealer is Allowed to Stay at the Table during Blackjack in NC?</h1><p>In North Carolina, the casino dealer is allowed to stay at the table during blackjack. There are no specific rules prohibiting the dealer from leaving the table during the game. In most cases, the dealer will not leave the table unless there is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>If you are playing blackjack in North Carolina, it is important to understand that the dealer is allowed to stay at the table. This means that you should not try to take advantage of the situation by leaving the table when the dealer leaves. The dealer is likely to notice if someone leaves the table and it can impact your chances of winning.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that you should not talk about your hand with other players at the table. The dealer is not allowed to listen in on your conversations and doing so could lead to a penalty. Instead, focus on playing your hand and leave the conversation for later.</p>
<p>When playing blackjack in North Carolina, it is important to understand the rules and how they impact your gameplay. By knowing what to expect, you can make sure that you are able to enjoy yourself while playing this popular casino game.</p>

One is that they cannot play the game, even if they are the only player at the table. Dealers can bet on the game, but they must do so from outside of the circle of players.</p>
<p>Another rule for dealers is that they must remain neutral and not show any signs of favouritism towards any player at the table. This means that they cannot help players with their decisions, give them information about how close they are to winning, or otherwise assist them in any way.</p>
<p>Dealers also need to be aware of when it is appropriate to draw cards and when it is time to stand pat. They should pay close attention to what each player’s hand looks like and make sure they are following the proper procedure for each situation.</p>
<p>Finally, dealers need to keep track of all the bets made during the game and ensure that all payouts are made correctly. They should also collect any losing bets and return chips to players at the end of the hand.</p>
