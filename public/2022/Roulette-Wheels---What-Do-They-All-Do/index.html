        <h1 id="Roulette-Wheels-What-Do-They-All-Do"><a href="#Roulette-Wheels-What-Do-They-All-Do" class="headerlink" title="Roulette Wheels - What Do They All Do?"></a>Roulette Wheels - What Do They All Do?</h1><p>There are many different types of roulette wheels on the market these days. But what do they all do, and more importantly, how do they work? In this article, we take a quick look at the most common types of roulette wheels available, and explore how they differ.</p>
<p>The first type of roulette wheel is the European wheel. This wheel has 37 pockets, numbered 1-36, plus a single zero pocket. The key difference between this and other types of wheels is that the European wheel offers better odds for players - the house edge is just 2.7%.</p>
<p>The American wheel has 38 pockets, numbered 1-36, plus two zero pockets (one green and one red). This gives the house an edge of 5.26%, making it less favourable for players.</p>
<p>The French wheel is similar to the European wheel, but with one changed number - instead of numbering 36-1-0, the French wheel goes 36-0-1. This subtle difference makes little practical difference to gameplay, but some purists believe it offers marginally better odds. Like the European wheel, the French wheel has a house edge of 2.7%.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the double zero American wheel - this has 38 pockets as described earlier, but with both zero pockets coloured green (European and French wheels have just one zero pocket coloured green). This increases the house edge to 7.89%, making it much less favourable for players than either the European or French wheels.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-The-Roulette-Wheel-Layout-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-The-Roulette-Wheel-Layout-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does The Roulette Wheel Layout Mean?"></a>What Does The Roulette Wheel Layout Mean?</h1><p>When you’re looking at a roulette wheel, there are a few specific things you should be aware of. The first is the layout of the wheel. This is important to understand because it will help you place your bets in the right places.</p>
<p>The Roulette Wheel Layout</p>
<p>There are 36 numbers on a roulette wheel, with 18 black numbers and 18 red numbers. There are also two green spaces on the wheel, one for 0 and one for 00. As you can see, there are 12 red numbers and 12 black numbers on opposite sides of the wheel.</p>
<p>The number sequence on a roulette wheel starts with 0 and ends with 36. This is why some people call black numbers red and vice versa – they’re simply following the order of the numbers on the wheel. If you’re betting on a particular number, you want to make sure that your bet is placed on the correct side of the wheel. For example, if you want to bet on black, your bet should be placed on the black number space on the wheel.</p>
<p>Betting Placement</p>
<p>When it comes to placing your bets, there are a few different things to consider. The first is where you want to place your bet relative to the spinning ball. You can either go for inside or outside bets. Inside bets are bets that are placed directly on top of one of the numbered spaces on the table layout. Outside bets are placed around these numbered spaces, in between them.</p>
<p>The second thing to consider is what type of bet you want to make. There are many different types of bets you can make in roulette, but some of the most popular ones include betting on colours (red or black), betting on whether or not the ball will land in a certain section of the wheel (even or odd), and betting on which number(s) will come up.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p> now that you know about roulette wheel layout and how to place your bets, go ahead and give it a try at an online casino!</p>
<h1 id="Differences-Between-American-And-European-Roulette-Wheels"><a href="#Differences-Between-American-And-European-Roulette-Wheels" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between American And European Roulette Wheels"></a>Differences Between American And European Roulette Wheels</h1><p>There are several differences between American and European roulette wheels. The most obvious one is that the American wheel has 38 slots, while the European wheel has 36 slots. This is because the American wheel has two zeroes - a 0 and a 00 - while the European wheel does not.</p>
<p>The addition of the 00 slot changed the odds of the game when it was introduced in America in 1842. While the house edge is still 2.7% on even money bets on the European wheel, it is 5.26% on the American wheel. This means that players lose more money playing American roulette than they do playing European roulette.</p>
<p>Another difference is that American wheels have deflectors around the perimeter of the wheel, which cause the ball to bounce around as it slows down. This increases the chances that the ball will end up in a slot other than where it was originally thrown. European wheels lack deflectors, so the ball travels in a more predictable path.</p>
<p>The differences between American and European roulette wheels can impact your betting strategy. When playing on an American wheel, you should avoid betting on even money odds, since your odds of winning are lower than on a European wheel. Instead, try betting on single numbers or combinations of numbers that offer better odds of winning.</p>
<h1 id="The-Types-Of-Roulette-Wheels"><a href="#The-Types-Of-Roulette-Wheels" class="headerlink" title="The Types Of Roulette Wheels"></a>The Types Of Roulette Wheels</h1><p>Roulette is a casino game which was invented in the seventeenth century by Blaise Pascal. The game has since grown in popularity and can now be found in most casinos around the world. Roulette is a simple game to play, but there are various different types of roulette wheels available, each with its own set of rules and odds.</p>
<p>There are three main types of roulette wheel - the European, American and French wheels. The European wheel has 37 pockets, while the American and French wheels have 38 pockets. The difference between the American and French wheels is that the American wheel has two green pockets - one for 0 and one for 00 - while the French wheel has just one green pocket for 0. This means that the odds on the American wheel are slightly different to those on the French wheel.</p>
<p>The third type of roulette wheel is known as a progressive jackpot wheel. This type of wheel has an additional pocket which is linked to a progressive jackpot prize pool. If a player wins on this pocket, they will win the entire jackpot prize pool.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Choose-The-Right-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#How-To-Choose-The-Right-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="How To Choose The Right Roulette Wheel"></a>How To Choose The Right Roulette Wheel</h1><p>There are a few things you need to take into account when choosing the right roulette wheel for your casino.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to consider is the size of the wheel. You want to make sure that the wheel will comfortably fit in your casino.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to consider is the number of pockets on the wheel. Most wheels have either 37 or 38 pockets, but there are some wheels with more or less pockets.</p>
<p>You also need to consider the colours of the pockets. There are a few different options here, but most casinos stick with traditional black and red numbers.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to consider the type of wheel. There are two main types of roulette wheels: European and American. The European wheel has 36 pockets and the American wheel has 38 pockets, including a double zero pocket.</p>
